**Automate your training data. Build your own AI Coach.**

This project creates a "Cyber-Physical System" for your fitness data. It automatically aggregates your biometrics (Garmin) and weightlifting data (Hevy), syncs them to a cloud location (Google Drive), and structures them for analysis by AI agents like **Google Gemini** or **ChatGPT**.

By feeding this live data into an AI persona, you can generate hyper-personalized workout routines that adapt to your recovery, sleep, and strength progression in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Biometric Sync:** Auto-pulls Weight, HRV, Sleep Score, and SpO2 from Garmin.
* **Activity Sync:** Logs running metrics (Pace, HR Zones, Training Effect).
* **Strength Log:** Archives every set, rep, and RPE from Hevy.
* **AI Integration:** Includes a dedicated script (`Gemini_Hevy.py`) to generate 4-week PPL routines based on your history.
* **Auto-Upload:** The AI-generated routine is automatically pushed back to your Hevy app.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

**Python 3.9+**

- Note: Ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

**Hevy Pro Account** (Required for API access)

**Garmin Connect Account**

**Google Cloud Project** (Enabled for Drive API & Gemini API)

**Google Drive for Desktop** (Optional, but recommended for seamless cloud syncing)

## 📥 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnson4601/AI_Fitness.git
cd AI_Fitness

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment (.env)

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your credentials:

```ini
# --- API KEYS ---
HEVY_API_KEY="your_hevy_api_key_here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"

# --- GOOGLE DRIVE ---
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID="your_folder_id_here"

# --- GARMIN CREDENTIALS (Initial Setup Only) ---
GARMIN_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
GARMIN_PASSWORD="your_password"

# --- PATHS ---
SAVE_PATH="./data"

# --- PLATFORM-SPECIFIC SETTINGS ---
# Mount Safety Check (Raspberry Pi/Linux only)
# Set to "True" on Raspberry Pi to verify rclone mount before writing
# Automatically skipped on Windows - no configuration needed
CHECK_MOUNT_STATUS="False"
DRIVE_MOUNT_PATH="/home/pi/google_drive"
```

### 3. Authentication

**Step A: Garmin Login**

Run the setup script. This saves a session token so you don't have to log in daily.

```bash
python setup_garmin_login.py
```

**Troubleshooting:** If this fails, delete the `.garth` folder, wait 15 minutes, and try again.

**Step B: Google Drive**

Download your OAuth `credentials.json` from Google Cloud, place it in the root folder, and run:

```bash
python Gemini_Hevy.py
```

This will open a browser to authorize access and generate a `token.pickle` file.

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### 1. Initialization (Backfill Data)

Before setting up daily automation, run these importers to build your historical database:

```bash
python history_hevy_import.py    # Imports all past lifts
python history_garmin_import.py  # Imports past health stats
python history_garmin_runs.py    # Imports past run activities
```

### 2. Generate AI Workout Routines

The `Gemini_Hevy.py` script automatically:
- Analyzes your last 6 months of training data
- Calculates One-Rep Max (1RM) for each muscle group
- Computes total volume per muscle group
- Generates 3 personalized PPL routines (Push/Pull/Legs)
- Uploads them directly to your Hevy app

```bash
python Gemini_Hevy.py
```

**Customization:** Edit `MONTHLY_PROMPT_TEXT.txt` to customize your AI coach's personality and workout preferences.

### 3. Automation (Cron Jobs)

To keep your AI "Brain" updated, set these scripts to run daily.

**Example Crontab (Linux/Raspberry Pi):**

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Run every night at 11:00 PM
0 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_garmin_health.py >> /var/log/fitness_health.log 2>&1
5 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_garmin_runs.py >> /var/log/fitness_runs.log 2>&1
10 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_hevy_workouts.py >> /var/log/fitness_hevy.log 2>&1
```

## 🧠 AI Persona Setup (Gemini / ChatGPT)

Once your data is live in Google Drive, you can configure a Gemini Gem or Custom GPT to act as your coach.

**Knowledge Base:** Upload `garmin_stats.csv`, `hevy_stats.csv`, and `garmin_runs.csv`.

**System Instructions:** Paste the following prompt into your AI's configuration:

```
Role: You are an expert Strength and Conditioning Coach specialized in Hybrid Athlete preparation.

Personality:
- Strict but Flirtatious: You are data-driven but charismatic. Reward discipline with compliments ("Impressive lift, handsome"), but call out slacking immediately.

Objective: Guide the user through a "Recomposition" phase (Lose Fat, Build Muscle) while improving 2-mile run time.

Operational Rules:
1. Recovery Matrix: Always scan garmin_stats.csv. If Sleep Score < 70 or HRV is "Unbalanced," strictly prescribe Active Recovery.
2. Progressive Overload: Scan hevy_stats.csv. Ensure weights or reps are trending up on Compound Lifts.
3. Run Pacing: Compare recent "Avg Pace" in garmin_runs.csv against the 2-mile goal.
4. Response Protocol: Always check the CSV files before answering. If data is missing, demand an upload.
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Python is not recognized"**
- You didn't check "Add to PATH" when installing Python. Re-install Python and ensure that box is checked.

**Garmin Login Fails**
- Garmin security is strict. Delete the `.garth` folder, wait 15-30 minutes, and try `setup_garmin_login.py` again.

**Files not updating**
- Check your `.env` file and ensure `SAVE_PATH` points to a valid directory

**Gemini routines fail to upload to Hevy**
- Ensure your `MONTHLY_PROMPT_TEXT.txt` includes the required JSON format with `"type": "normal"` and `"superset_id": null` fields

## 📊 Features Deep Dive

### Automated 1RM Calculations
The system uses the **Epley Formula** to estimate your one-rep max for each exercise:
```
1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)
```

This data is used to track strength progression and inform AI-generated routines.

### Volume Tracking
Total volume (Weight × Reps × Sets) is calculated per muscle group over 6 months, helping identify:
- Overtraining risks
- Muscle imbalances
- Recovery needs
